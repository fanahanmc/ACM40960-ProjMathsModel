### Jupyter Notebook

This project has been programmed using Python within a Jupyter Notebook. These notebooks allow users to seamlessly blend multiple blocks of code and text within a single document that is easy to navigate. You can run these notebooks using either *Jupyter Notebook* or (preferably) *JupyterLab*. These are both web-based IDEs/UIs, and the easiest way to access them is by installing and running *Anaconda*. *Anaconda* can be downloaded from the following link: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual.
