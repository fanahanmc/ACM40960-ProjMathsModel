# Monte Carlo Simulation of Fixtures and Betting Systems for the English Premier League
***Created by Fanahan McSweeney (Student Number: 20203868)***

## Overview

This project has been programmed using Python within a Jupyter Notebook. These notebooks allow users to seamlessly blend multiple blocks of code and text within a single document that is easy to navigate. You can run these notebooks using an appropriate IDE/UI, such as *Jupyter Notebook* or (preferably) *JupyterLab*.

The main project notebook included in this repository (***CM40960_Project_20203868.ipynb***) has already been executed in full, with all relevant plots, figures and results already visible. Therefore, the fully executed file can be viewed by clicking on the file name directly on GitHub. Alternatively, if you would like to access a copy of the notebook and execute it yourself, then proceed to the **Getting Started** section below.

## Getting Started

If you haven't used Jupyter Notebooks before, then first download and install *Anaconda*, the latest version of which [can be downloaded from here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

After completing the installation, open *Anaconda-Navigator* and select *Launch* on the *JupyterLab* pane (highligthed in the image below).

Next, you can clone this GitHub repository onto your local machine. On GitHub, navigate to the repository (you should already be here if you're reading this README file...), select the green *Code* button, and then select the clipboard button beside the link to copy the repo link (highligthed in the image below).

Then open a terminal window on your local machine and navigate to the location where you want to save the repository. Then type *git clone* and paste the URL copied earlier, and enter the command.
```bash
git clone PASTE-REPOSITORY-URL-HERE
```
Finally, return to the *JupyterLab* window launched previously, click on the folder icon in the top left corner of the window, and navigate to the newly created project folder. Then double-click on the *ACM40960_Project_20203868.ipynb* file located in this folder to open the Jupyter Notebook (highlighted in the folder navigation pane in the image below).
