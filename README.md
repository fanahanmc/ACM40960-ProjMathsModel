## Overview

This project has been programmed using Python within a Jupyter Notebook. These notebooks allow users to seamlessly blend multiple blocks of code and text within a single document that is easy to navigate. You can run these notebooks using an appropriate IDE/UI, such as *Jupyter Notebook* or (preferably) *JupyterLab*.

## Getting Started

If you haven't used Jupyter Notebooks before, then first download and install *Anaconda*, the latest version of which can be downloaded from the following link: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual. 
After completing the installation, open *Anaconda-Navigator* and select *Launch* on the *JupyterLab* pane (see image below).
