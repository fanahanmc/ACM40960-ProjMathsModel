## Overview

This project has been programmed using Python within a Jupyter Notebook. These notebooks allow users to seamlessly blend multiple blocks of code and text within a single document that is easy to navigate. You can run these notebooks using an appropriate IDE/UI, such as *Jupyter Notebook* or (preferably) *JupyterLab*.

## Getting Started

If you haven't used Jupyter Notebooks before, then first download and install *Anaconda*, the latest version of which [can be downloaded from here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

After completing the installation, open *Anaconda-Navigator* and select *Launch* on the *JupyterLab* pane (highligthed in the image below).

Next, you can clone this GitHub repository onto your local machine. On GitHub, navigate to the repository (you should already be here if you're reading this README file...), select the green *Code* button, and then select the clipboard button beside the link to copy the repo link (highligthed in the image below).

Then open a terminal window on your local machine, and navigate to the location where you want to save the repository. Then type *git clone* and paste the URL copied earlier, and enter the command:
```bash
git clone COPIED-REPOSITORY-URL
```
